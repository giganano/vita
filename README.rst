This repository holds the source files for my Curriculum Vita.
Running ``make`` will produce the vita itself, a version without a list of
publications, and a stand-alone publications list. Running ``make vita.pdf``,
``make vita-nopubs.pdf``, and ``make pubslist.pdf`` will produce the
desired single document as opposed to all three.
